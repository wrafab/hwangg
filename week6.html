 <h1> WEEK 6 </h1>

 <a> Vaccuming Forming and Lamination- Skateboards </a>
 
 <a> We started to use the Laser Cutter to cut through object or engrave on it. Laser cutting is basically just a laser on a CNC gantry. After we set vectors, points, the machine will operate as how we want. 
  First, I made a press fit kit using cardboard. It was important to cut out several of each shape and make sure they fit together snuggly. Next, I designed a sunflower for a Laser Cut Clock. I used spray paints to design my clock. 
  Then, I engraved a bottle. This was easy because we have done this before using cardboard. Lastly, I engraved a aluminum bookmark. This took 2minutes to engrave.</a>
